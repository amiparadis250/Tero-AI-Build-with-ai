## The Challenge Tero AI Solves

Rwanda has made significant strides in digital transformation, yet two critical gaps persist in digital upskilling:

1.  **Misalignment with Industry Needs:** A disconnect between traditional training content and the evolving demands of employers. Many programs lack depth in emerging areas like DevOps, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and advanced UX/UI, leaving graduates underprepared.
2.  **Geographic and Infrastructure Barriers:** Digital training and talent development remain largely concentrated in urban centers, neglecting rural populations due to limited access to training programs, poor internet connectivity, and high data costs.

**Tero AI directly addresses these challenges by making specialized digital education universally accessible and practically relevant.**

## How Tero AI Works

At its core, Tero AI leverages advanced generative AI to create on-demand learning content.

### Core Functionality: Text/Voice-to-Video Tutorials

* **Prompt-Driven Learning:** Users simply type or speak a request (e.g., "Explain how to set up a basic e-commerce store," "Show me how to use Python for data analysis," "Fundamentals of cloud security for small businesses").
* **AI-Powered Video Generation:** Our AI engine processes the prompt, synthesizes relevant information, and generates a clear, step-by-step video tutorial complete with visuals, narration, and practical examples.
